		<h1>Kevin Sornberger</h1>
		
		<p>You can find me <a href="http://twitter.com/ksornberger">on Twitter</a> or send an email to ksornberger at gmail.</p>
		
		<p>I was previously the senior software architect at <a href="http://www.fusenet.ca">Fusenet</a> in Oakville, Ontario. I got to build and design a unique video streaming application called <a href="http://www.graboid.com">Graboid</a>, and was part of this team since the company was 4 smart people crammed in one very tiny room hacking away.</p>
				
		<p>Recently I've teamed up with 2 other bright individuals to form a new company called <a href="http://www.devbbq.com">DevBBQ</a> to work on some projects we've been wanting to get off the ground and work on some client contracts when interesting opportunities present themselves. We've recently launched an iPhone app called <a href="http://www.coffeedash.com">CoffeeDash</a>, it's free so you should check it out on the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/coffeedash/id419907913?mt=8&ls=1">App Store</a>. We're also working on a new product called <a href="http://www.userclues.com">UserClues</a>, which helps you to better understand how your customers are using your applications.</p>
		
		<p>I received my Bachelor of Engineering degree with a minor in business from <a href="http://www.mcmaster.ca">McMaster University</a> in Hamilton, Ontario and an currently living in Oakville.</p>
		
		 <p>I'm always up for meeting new people or getting together to chat/argue about tech things or whatever topics are trending on Twitter that day. This is especially true if a cold beer is involved so drop me a line if you want to say hi.</p>
