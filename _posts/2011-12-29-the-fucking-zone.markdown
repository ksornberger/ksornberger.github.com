title: The Fucking Zone
---

I'm struggling a little big right now. I'll admit that I am, and I'm not 100% sure why either. I really wish I could get in the fucking zone right now and hammer something great out. You know exactly what I'm talking about don't you? Hell... even if you're not a developer, you've probably seen The Social Network and Zuckerberg talking about this programmers being 'dialed in'. I have a few friends that are developers who like to make fun of that scene in the movie, I'm not sure if it's just because of how Zuckerberg makes it seem cheesy, or if it's because they're mocking the idea. If it's the latter, I feel sorry for them and their employers because they've obviously never been there.

2 Things that help me get there
 - the code is interesting (Somehow!)
 - I know what I need to do -task/todo list
